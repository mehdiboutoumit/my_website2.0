## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node JS installed. If you don't have it:

-   [Download it from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
-   [Install it using NVM ](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
-   If you're on Mac, Homebrew is a good option too:

```
brew install node
```

2. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/mehdiboutoumit/my_website/
```

3. Open the project folder:

```
cd my_website
```

4. Install packages and dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. NOTE: If you want to use yarn and you don't have it installed, you can install it globally using npm:

```
npm install --global yarn
```

5. Start a local dev server at `http://localhost:3000`:
```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
